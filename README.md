# smscli-server
The corresponding Android server for smscli-client

# Install
In the future the app will be added to Fdroid, currently you will have to build it yourself.

# Notes
This has had zero testing with Android devices other then my own. Should work though on most modern devices running a Android
version greater then 4.4 KitKat. The reason is that before that the SMS API was non official. 

There could theoretically be issues with permissions for devices running something before Marshmallow, the Support libraries are used though so there should not be a problem.
